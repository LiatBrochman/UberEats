## About The Project

The UberEats project is a food delivery application developed 
for customers, couriers, and owners. 

The app utilizes React Native (Expo) and Google Maps API for live data syncing by subscribing to location update events and canvas rerendering. 

AWS Amplify was employed for auto backend development, 
auto-building the schema (GraphQL), data storage management (DynamoDB), auto-generating smart fetching mechanism (DataStore), including auto-local storage maintenance, hosting and deploying the app, and more.
